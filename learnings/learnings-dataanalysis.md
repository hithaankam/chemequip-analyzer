# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisation

## Date
24-01-2026

## Goal
To understand what extent and approach of DA suites analysis process for chemical equipment data.

## Notes
Focus Area 1: Scientific notations(eg.float - 2.0 or 2.01)
Focus Area 2: Null Values and duplicates(threshold columns that can hold the same values)
Focus Area 3: Unique values for each attribute
Focus Area 4: Sorting and reverse sorting attribute values for univariate analysis like (top x% of some attribute) with the help of histograms, density plots, bar charts
Focus Area 5: Correlation with heatmap can help model bivariate visualisations along with pairplot and scatter plot
Focus Area 6:GroupBy and perform statistics(Particularly helps Type attribute in our use case)
Focus Area 7: Outliers with boxplots
Focus Area 8: Data types skimming

## Technical insights
use ggplot
use "query" method
use line breaks while coding "\"
## Future Scope
Ask questions and obtain a plot(can use groupBy, query and aggregate methods)
